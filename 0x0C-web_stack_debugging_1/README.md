# 0x0C-web_stack_debugging_1

## Description

This Repo has some of my (David John Coleman II) projects for Bootcamp School.
The focus of these projects have been learning Bash and other sysadmin/ devops
technologies.

## Environment

* __OS:__ Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* __Language:__ Bash
* __Style:__ Shellcheck v. 0.3.3

## Assignment

Using your debugging skills, find out what's keeping your Ubuntu container's
Nginx installation from listening on port 80. Feel free to install whatever
tool you need, start and destroy as many containers as you need to debug the
issue. Then, write a Bash script with the minimum number of commands to
automate your fix.

__Requirements:__

* Nginx must be running, and listening on port 80 of all the server's active
  IPv4 IPs
* Write a Bash script that configures a server to the above requirements
